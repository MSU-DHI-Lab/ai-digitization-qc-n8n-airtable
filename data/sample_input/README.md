# Sample Input Scans

This folder is reserved for example input images used when demonstrating the workflow.

You can include:

- A high-quality scan (full page, no finger in frame, well lit).
- A low-quality scan (cropped or skewed) to show how the AI model flags issues.

Actual image files are not included in this public repo to avoid unnecessary size and rights complications.
